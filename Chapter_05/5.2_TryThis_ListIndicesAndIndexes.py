'''TRY THIS: LIST SLICES AND INDEXES
 Using what you know about the len()
function and list slices, how would you combine the two to get the second half
of a list when you donâ€™t know what size it is? Experiment in the Python shell
to confirm that your solution works.'''

x= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

y= int(len(x)/2)
print(x+x[y:])

z= (len(x)//2)
print(x+x[z:])
